# personal_loan_prediction_ml_mode
This project, hosted at itsprady/personal_loan_prediction_ml_model, is focused on predicting personal loan approvals using machine learning techniques. The repository likely contains the code, data processing scripts, and model artifacts necessary to train and deploy a predictive model for personal loan applications.

Project Overview:

Purpose: To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant features (such as income, credit history, employment status, etc.).
Features: The project may include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (possibly using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or others), evaluation metrics, and deployment scripts.
Deployment: The model's interface is deployed via a web app, allowing users to input their information and instantly get a prediction.
Live Demo: You can interact with the model and see a visual representation of the prediction workflow at the following Streamlit app: Loan Predictor by Pradip

What you'll find in the Visual:

A user-friendly web interface to input personal and financial details.
Real-time prediction of loan approval status.
Possible data visualizations or explanation of the model's decision.
